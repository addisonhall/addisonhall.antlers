"Antlers" Statamic syntax highlighting for Visual Studio Code
=============================================================

This started as a weekend project to bring Statamic tag syntax highlighting to Sublime Text. I pulled a lot of the information for this from this ExpressionEngine bundle: https://github.com/fcgrx/ExpressionEngine2-Sublime-Text-3-Bundle and looking at this documentation: http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html. ~~In all honesty, I still don't understand why much of the syntax works. I was able to port the Sublime Text version over to Atom.~~ I have a much better understanding of how grammars work now, so future versions should work much better.

I called this Antlers because it was just fun... I mean, heck... everything about Statamic is fun.

What is Statamic?
-----------------

Statamic (http://statamic.com) is a no-database, flat-file content management system that is far more capable than you would ever expect it to be. It's crazy fun to develop with as well.
